# Programming Portfolio

## Overview

This repository showcases my journey through C# programming, spanning beginner to advanced levels. Each project reflects my growth in understanding C# syntax, object-oriented programming, and advanced concepts like networking, asynchronous programming, and image processing. Below, I detail the projects I’m most proud of, organized by course level, with links to their respective implementations.

## Beginner C# Programming

In my first term of C# programming, I focused on mastering syntax and foundational concepts. One of my favorite projects was **Pong**, a classic arcade game. This project was a milestone as it introduced me to game development in C#. I implemented basic game mechanics, including paddle movement, ball physics, and collision detection, without using classes or methods, which made it a great exercise in procedural programming.

- **Pong**: A simple yet engaging game that helped me understand user input handling and real-time updates in C#.

## Intermediate C# Programming

As I progressed to intermediate C#, I explored more complex applications, including web-based projects and desktop applications. These projects deepened my understanding of classes, methods, and data structures.

- **Monopoly**: Developed as a web-based game, this project challenged me to implement game logic for property management, player turns, and transactions. It was my first exposure to integrating C# with web technologies, enhancing my skills in front-end and back-end coordination.
- **BallZ**: A dynamic game where players control bouncing balls, focusing on physics-based movement and collision detection. This project solidified my understanding of object-oriented programming by using classes to manage game entities.
- **DupFinder**: A utility to identify duplicate files in a directory. I implemented file I/O operations and hashing algorithms to compare file contents, learning about performance optimization and data handling.
- **PicBlender**: An image manipulation tool that blends two images. This project introduced me to pixel-level image processing in C#, teaching me about bitmap manipulation and color theory.

## Advanced C# Programming

In the advanced course, I tackled sophisticated projects involving networking, real-time applications, and asynchronous programming. These labs pushed me to apply C# in innovative ways, from server-client architectures to live collaborative tools.

- **HiLo**: A server-client guessing game using sockets. Players guess a number, with the server providing feedback. This project taught me about TCP/IP networking, socket programming, and multi-threaded applications in C#.
- **MultiDrawer**: A real-time collaborative drawing board where multiple users can draw simultaneously. I implemented a client-server model with live updates, diving deep into network synchronization and UI rendering.
- **ImageReducer**: A tool to compress images by reducing their resolution or quality. This project enhanced my skills in image processing and optimization, focusing on balancing quality and file size.
- **MazeSolver**: An algorithm-driven project that solves mazes using techniques like depth-first search. It was a great exercise in algorithmic thinking and visualizing solutions in C#.
- **TAP_Chat**: A chat application leveraging async and await for responsive communication. This project was pivotal in mastering Task Asynchronous Programming (TAP) in C#, ensuring smooth user experiences in real-time applications.

## Reflections

Working on these projects has been a rewarding journey. Starting with basic syntax in **Pong**, I progressed to complex systems like **MultiDrawer** and **TAP_Chat**, which required integrating multiple C# features—classes, async programming, and networking. Each project built on the last, reinforcing concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism while introducing new challenges like performance optimization and scalability.

C#’s versatility has been a highlight, allowing me to create games, utilities, and networked applications. I’m particularly proud of my growth in asynchronous programming, which I explored deeply in **TAP_Chat**, and my ability to handle real-time systems, as seen in **MultiDrawer**. These experiences have prepared me for professional development, where robust, scalable code is essential.
