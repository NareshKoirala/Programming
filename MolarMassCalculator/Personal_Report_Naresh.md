# Naresh Prasad Koirala Personal Report on How It Went

## Project Start and Form UI
Initially, JT created the project and implemented the Form UI along with the drag-and-drop methods. We worked together on sorting methods, and I converted them to LINQ functions for:
- SortByName
- SingleCharacterSearch
- SortByAtom
- SearchByFormula

JT focused on the functionality, while I changed the code to use LINQ. At first, the SearchByFormula function did not return the name of the element; it only returned the symbol. I was able to fix this using LINQ.

## Contributions to Functions
I also added the Total Mass of the formula function using LINQ. JT and I worked together on small functions like SortByName, SingleCharacterSearch, and SortByAtom. JT fully handled the CSV file conversion and the formula search using regex. I successfully completed the tier-system search function. Updated most of the missing function after the presentation with the suggestion by Sir, Herb:
- Invalid chemical formula check
- Atomic number search
- Added join

## Challenges Faced
I faced some challenges with the search method as I initially did not understand what it was asking. After clarifying with Sir Herb, I was able to succeed. I didn't know that 'descending' was a function for LINQ, but with guidance from Adrian, who literally told me it was, I was able to fix the sorting issue as the filter was working.

## GIT Conflicts
We also had issues with GIT conflicts as both JT and I were pushing code at the same time. To resolve this, I had to ask JT to take a break so that we could better coordinate our efforts.

## Conclusion
Overall, JT and I both worked on different parts of the project. Despite some challenges and conflicts, we were able to complete our tasks successfully.
